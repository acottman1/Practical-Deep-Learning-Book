        "With both the data and model ready, all we have left to do is train the model. This is also known as fitting the model to the data. For training any model, we need to pick a loss function, an optimizer, initial learning rate and a metric. Let's discuss these briefly:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Loss function**: The loss function is the objective being minimized. For example, in a task to predict house prices, the loss function could be the mean squared error.\n",
        "- **Optimizer**: This is an optimization algorithm that helps minimize the loss function. We’ll choose `Adam`, one of the fastest optimizers out there.\n",
        "- **Learning rate**: This defines how quickly or slowly you update the weights during training. Choosing an optimal learning rate is crucial - a big value can cause the training process to jump around, missing the target. On the other hand, a tiny value can cause the training process to take ages to reach the target. We’ll keep it at 0.001 for now.\n",
        "- **Metric**: Choose a metric to judge the performance of the trained model. Accuracy is a good explainable metric, especially when the classes are not imbalanced, i.e. roughly equal in size. Note that this metric is not used during training to maximize or minimize an objective.\n",
        "\n",
        "You might have noticed the term `epoch` here. One epoch means a full training step where the network has gone over the entire dataset.  One epoch may consist of several mini-batches.\n",
        "\n",
        "Run this program and let the magic begin. If you don’t have a GPU, brew a cup of coffee while you wait. You’ll notice 4 statistics - `loss` and `accuracy` on both the training and validation data. You are rooting for the `val_acc`."
